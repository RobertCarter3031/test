## If I had a week to work on this:

* Utilize CSS library to strengthen styles
* Finish the Rental Listing Card component - description, price, etc
* Advanced search filters - dates, location, price, beds, etc
* Improve pagination -- infinite scrolling, handling what happens when you get to the "end of the data"
* Add E2E testing
* Accessibility - screen reader, keyboard input handling
